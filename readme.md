As part of my Master's program coursework, I conducted a study on clustering algorithms and documented my findings in a Jupyter notebook that is available in this Github repository. The notebook includes code that I developed from scratch to implement the basic K-Means algorithm using Python. Additionally, I discuss various variations of the K-Means algorithm, including K-Means++, spectral clustering, and agglomerative clustering. The report also covers the applications of clustering algorithms in image processing, with a specific focus on image compression and color dimension reduction.
